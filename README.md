A in development Dark Souls Spreadsheet for building in advance our character

This Spreadsheet is very simple, the objective here is to make a status character for Dark Souls I to players plan their gamepla in advance. Still needs grab all the information about Weapons and Armour and to implement formulas to it.
Also in the future I want to implement VBA coding to it, but for now I'm keeping to the basics.

If anyone have interest in developing feel free.
